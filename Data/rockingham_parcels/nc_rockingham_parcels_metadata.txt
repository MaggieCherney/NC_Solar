  Description:


    Abstract: This digital geospatial dataset represents parcel boundaries with standard core attributes for a parcel data from Rockingham County, transformed by the North Carolina Integrated Cadastral Data Exchange project.  This is one of 100 counties that share source datasets as a basis for a standardized dataset with consistent attributes (fields).  The individual standardized county data sets are designed to be aggregated into a single dataset. The source geometry as published by individual county data producers is unchanged by the standardization of attributes.  This dataset includes attributes such as ownership, area in acres, assessed value, and other core cadastral attributes.


    Purpose: This dataset was generated to publish a set of parcel polygons with standardized attributes for statewide analysis and mapping in North Carolina. The integrated data is intended to serve business needs that require information from multiple counties, e.g., response to a natural disaster, analysis of economic development potential, environmental assessments, and highway planning to name a few.  An aggregated cadastral dataset serves to support and assist governmental agencies and others in resource management decisions. Additionally, these data provide a set of core attributes defined by the Integrated Cadastral Data Exchange project with the intention of adoption by the North Carolina Geographic Information Coordinating Council to update the current North Carolina Content Elements for Statewide Publication of Core Geospatial Parcel Data. The aggregated dataset is intended to facilitate the sharing, display, and use of cadastral data across the state.


    Supplemental_Information: The NC Parcel Transformer applications and web feature service were developed under a grant from the US Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Information Exchange Network, to the NC Department of Information Technology.  The project was initiated by the NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council, Statewide Mapping Advisory Committee's Working Group for Seamless Parcels in 2009. The project team includes NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (grant and project manager), Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the Land Records Management Program in the Department of the Secretary of State, NC Department of Transportation, NC Division of Emergency Management, NC Department of Revenue, and a contractor team managed by The Carbon Project, Inc. that included Fairview Industries, Inc., and Atlas Geographic Data, Inc. The source data provided by North Carolina counties is prepared for the inventory of real property found within a jurisdiction and is compiled from recorded deeds, plats, and other public records and data. Assessed value of real property is based on market value as defined in the Machinery Act of North Carolina (Section 105-283). The year of latest appraisal of value varies by county. Users of this dataset are hereby notified that the authoritative information sources should be consulted for more information about the source data. The State of North Carolina assumes no legal responsibility for information contained in this dataset. The information on time and reference is for the transformed data set. Information on county contributed data must be obtained from the identified data steward. The data steward for each parcel dataset is identified in the core dataset attributes.The initial aggregated parcel dataset included 25 of 100 counties in North Carolina. The 2015 dataset included all counties and lands of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

  Access_Constraints: Data may be accessed and viewed online. For authoritative source data, contact the Identified Data Steward of the North Carolina county or counties of interest.


  Use_Constraints: This dataset is an inventory of county representations of tax parcels.  This dataset is not a survey document and should not be utilized as such. An excerpt from an opinion of the NC Attorney General in 1982 is relevant for this dataset and its constituent source datasets: “North Carolina General Statutes 143-345.6(c) 92) provides that the Secretary of Administration “shall, in cooperation with the Secretary of Revenue, conduct a program for the preparation of county property-line maps under the direction of qualified surveyors pursuant to standards prepared by the Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources and Community Development.” The mapping program is part of the "land records management program" which the Legislature has directed the Secretary of Administration to establish "for the purposes (i) of advising registers of deeds, local tax officials, and local planning officials about sound management practices; and (ii) of establishing greater uniformity in local land records systems" G.S.143-345.6(a).  Thus, the program's sole purposes are directed toward needs of units of government.  There is not the least intimation that it is, or is intended to be, a substitute for the certificate of title provided by an attorney who has examined the record title to land for a client, or for a surveyor's certificate and plat provided by a professional engineer or registered land surveyor who has located the lines on the ground, examined the land for easements, encroachments, etc. and reported the same to his client.  It is our opinion that by providing a copy of a map, prepared purely and simply for the purposes mandated by the land records management program, to one who purchases it for some other use, no unit of government or local official incurs any liability to the purchaser or user for errors on the map.”  See http://ncdoj.gov/About-DOJ/Legal-Services/Legal-Opinions/Opinions/52-13.aspx. Note: The Land Records Management Program was transferred from the Department of Administration to the Department of the Secretary of State after this opinion by the Attorney General.

  Data_Set_Credit: This dataset was transformed by the Project Team and Vendor Team for the NC Integrated Cadastral Data Exchange Project, funded by US EPA Environmental Information Exchange Network.  Source datasets were furnished by data managers in North Carolina Counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.    


Data_Quality_Information:


  Attribute_Accuracy:


    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of attributes depends on the accuracy in source datasets and appropriate translation of county published attribute names to standard core parcel attribute names.  The Project Team and Vendor Team used spot checks of attributes compared to source datasets. Visual inspection of selected parcels included location address attributes over a street network.  In addition, the project reviewed missing values in the core attributes identified in the attribute database.  


  Logical_Consistency_Report: Source data managers (data stewards) and parcel mappers use GIS software to check for topology consistency during the parcel mapping process.  Source quality control ensures there are no duplicate lines, gaps, overlaps, undershoots, or overshoots.  For this integrated dataset, geometry is accepted as published by the source. 


  Completeness_Report: Source data managers are expected to create and maintain all boundary lines represented on deeds and plats transferred to digital files; map definition conforms to the "Technical Specifications for Base, Cadastral and Digital Mapping" (NC Land Records Management Program, NC  Secretary of State's Office).


  Positional_Accuracy:


    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:


      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Typically, the source datasets were originally compiled by digitizing tax maps and were compiled according to the "Specifications for Base, Cadastral and Digital Mapping" (NC Land Records Management Program, NC Secretary of State's Office).  For updates, information from deeds and plats were digitized and entered using coordinate geometry and adjusted to or with the surrounding existing line work.  Attributes were transferred from recorded deeds and plats.  Unrecorded plats may be used also for accuracy reference.  Control is also provided by referencing quality standard orthophoto base maps during the mapping process.

    Process_Step:


      Process_Description: The contractor for the Integrated Cadastral Data Exchange, the Carbon Project, Inc., designed a geospatial database with a parcel data schema consistent with the core standard developed by the Working Group for Seamless Parcels.  Subject matter experts on the contractor's team (Fairview Industries, Inc. and Atlas Geographic Data, Inc.) analyzed source cadastral datasets, developed crosswalks to the standard attributes, and identified domains, enumerations, and queries to aid the translation. Carbon Project, Inc. developed an application to transform source datasets to standard datasets (translating source fields to core standard fields).  Carbon Project, Inc. generated vector data in shapefile format and web services in multiple formats for data exchange. Quality control was accomplished by comparing sample parcel identification numbers with source datasets and comparing the number of records in source and transformed datasets. Geometry was accepted as submitted by the sources. Proejction was verified (NC State Plane, NAD 1983 US Survey feet).

      Attribute_Definition: The date of transformation of the source parcels to a standardized dataset. Transformation occurs in most cases the same day as the latest available county parcel dataset is uploaded to the Transformer. The latest available county parcel dataset may vary from county to county in its currency in terms of associated county property tax records and property boundaries. This is expressed as a date field.

  Overview_Description:


    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview: The attributes are publication elements that meet common producer and stakeholder needs for sharing, display, and use of geospatial parcel data, especially to cast into regional and statewide applications. As part of the NC Integrated Cadastral Data Exchange Project, a tool that transforms the county source parcel attributes to a standard set of attributes produces a translation model that may be expressed as a cross-walk from the source (shared by the county) to the target (standard core attributes).
